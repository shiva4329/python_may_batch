operators --> which can perform particular operations by using operends(like addition,substraction,multiplication....)


# ex : x+y -: operends are x,y
            -: operator +


# types of operators in python

    1. arthimatic operators
    2. assignment operators
    3. comparison operators
    4. logical operators
    5. membership operators
    6. identity operators



1. arthimatic operators

    addition : +
    substraction -: -
    multiplication -: *
    division ---: / (returns co-efficient with decimal point) like 2.0
    floor division -: // (returns co-efficient with out decimal point) like 2
    modulus -: % (returns reminder)
    exponent -: **

2. assignment operators

    assign : =
    addition assign -: +=
    sub assign --: -=
    multiplication assign --: *=
    division assign --: /=
    floor assign -: //=
    modulus assign -: %=

3. comparison operators

    equals to ==
    greater than  >
    less than <
    greater than equals : >=
    less than equals : <=
    not equals : !=

4. logical operators

    AND ----> T and F = F
    OR ----> T or F = T
    NOT ----> not T = F

5. membership operators

    in

    not in

6 .identity operators

    is

    is not
