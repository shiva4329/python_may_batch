#while loop Assignments

1.program to reverse a given no
  ex----> n=123    o/p : 321

2.Program to compute digital sum of a number
  ex: ---> n=123  digitalsum=1+2+3=6

3.Program to check whether a number is a pallindrome or not
  ex: ----->n=131   if we reverse also u should get the same no 131

4.Program to check whether a given no is a Armstrong No or not
  ex:  n=153  is a Armstrong no

  Armstromg no: if the sum of the cubes of the digits of a number is equal
                to the given number , then it is a armstrong number.

5.program to check whether a given number is a unique no or not.
  ex: 1089 is a unique number

      unique no-----> take any number(1089) , multiply with highest digit(9)
                      and reverse the result that u get , then u should get
                       the same number, then it is a unique number

    n=1089
        *9
      ----
      9801 ----->reverse it--->1089 ,u shi=ould get the same number

6.Program to find the factorial of a given number

7.Program to check whether a given number is a strong number or not
 ex:  n=145 is a strong number

      strong number: the sum of the factorials of the digits of a number
                     is equal to the given number , then it is a strong number.
      n=145
        1!+4!+5!
        1+24+120
        =145

8.Program to check whether a given number is a Perfect Number or not.
  ex: 6 is a perfect no

      perfect no: If the sum of the factors of a no is equal to the given number
                  then it is a perfect number
      factors for 6----->3+2+1==6

9.Program to check whether a given number is a prime number or not.

10.PRogram to check whether a given number is a even number or a odd number.
