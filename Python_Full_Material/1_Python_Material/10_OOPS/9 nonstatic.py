7.In java,non-static variables can't be added to object
      but in python we can

    8. All non-static variables declared within the class are
       given to objects
       ex: for 100 objects,for every object initially
           non-static variable values are same.
      so while creating objects only,we can give our own
      values by using constructor
      here no default value for non-static variable
