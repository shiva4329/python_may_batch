#Tuples:

A Tuple is a collection datatype which holds group of values

Tuple Properties:

1)A Tuple represented using ()

2)Tuple allows homogeneous elements (same type)      ex: x=(10,20,30,40,50)

3)Tuple allows heterogeneous elements (different types) ex: (501,"miller",6.1,True)

4)Tuple allows duplicate elements

5)In Tuple, insertion order is preserved, the order in which the elements are inserted
  in the same order they are stored

6)Tuple supports indexing.
  Tuple supports 2 types of indexing
  1. Forward index or Positive index : starts from left to right --->starts with 0.
  2. Backward index or Negative index: starts from right to left ---->starts with -1.

7.Tuple is a immutable object , changes and modifications are not allowed within a tuple.
   within the tuple, we can have mutable and immutable elements.

8. Tuple can be created directly by using () or by using tuple() function
