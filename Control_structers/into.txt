Control structures : it will control the flow

1. conditions
2. loops



1. conditions: if condition/expression is true allows the block of code to execute

    if 
    elif
    else


2.loops : nothing but iterations, runs till condition/expression false

    for - loops through no of items
    while - loops through untill condition is false

    break - breaks the loop
    continue - skips the current iteration
    pass - does nothing
